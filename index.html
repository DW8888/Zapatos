            Humans have always taken pride in presenting their taste, uniqueness,
            and style. Growing up in the 90s and 2000s, we had a very distinct way
            of showcasing our tastes:
             KICKS <br>
             <br>
            There were a
            vast number of styles, brands, and colors to choose from. As a teen boy
            who loved basketball, I gravitated toward kicks as not only a coolness
            measuring stick but also as  fertilizer for my dream of growing to be 6'7"
            and jumping high enough to throw down a windmill. Spoiler alert :that
            didn't happen. <br>
            <br>  But every time I slipped into a new pair of kicks, it
            brought happiness that only makes sense to a 16-year-old kid vying for
            respect at his local basketball court. So, in the spirit of celebrating
            youth and style, I'd like to share my favorite kicks of all time!
